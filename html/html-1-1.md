# HTML 1

## EMMET shortcuts

In VS code to get basic use  **! + enter**

```css
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    

</body>
</html>
```

To access your keybind in VScode use **F1**, normally it should be handled by the **tab** but in case go to **File&gt;Preferences&gt;Settings** and search this setting

```css
"emmet.triggerExpansionOnTab": true
```

Remember to use **Tab** at the end of the Emmet line.

### What makes a web page?

**Separation of Concerns:** In computer science, separation of concerns \(SoC\) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, so that each section addresses a separate concern \([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)\).

### HTML Syntax

You learned HTML code during your application process. If you want to refresh your memory, read this [quick guide to the HTML syntax](http://marksheet.io/html-syntax.html).

All together, let's review the basic syntax in the following example:

```markup
<article>
    <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
    <p>Get to know the HTML basics.</p>
    <a href="http://html5rocks.com">Read Article</a>
</article>
```

> **Exercise**: Which parts are the **Tags** and which parts are the **Attributes**.

HTML tags are arranged in a hierarchy. This is sometimes called "nesting" tags or creating an HTML "tree". Between the opening `<article>` tag and the closing `</article>` tag there are three other tags. We call these "child" tags, because they have a parent-child relationship.

> **Exercise**: As a group, let's try to name all of the parent and child tags in the following example.

```markup
<article>
    <h1>Learning HTML</h1>
    <p>
        <span class="author">Author:</span>
        <a href="http://codeyourfuture.co">Code Your Future</a>
    </p>
    <p>Get to know the HTML basics.</p>
    <a href="http://html5rocks.com">Read Article</a>
</article>
```

### Begin Individual Exercises

During this module, you will use an [exercise project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/html-css-git-exercises) to practice what you learn. To begin, open the [repository](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/html-css-git-exercises), scroll down and follow the instructions in the image below.

For now, stop after you complete exercises 1 and 2.

### Semantic HTML

When writing HTML code, you can use different tags to describe the content. Is it a navigation menu, a paragraph of text, or an article? By using the correct tag, you help search engines like Google or screen readers for the visually impaired.

> Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or **meaning**, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_HTML)

We'll cover the following semantic tags and talk about their use on the [BBC News website](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news):

* `<header role="banner"></header>`
* `<footer role="contentinfo"></footer>`
* `<main role="main"></main>`
* `<nav></nav>`
* `<article></article>`
* `<aside role="complementary"></aside>`

There are more than 100 semantic tags. If you would like, you can [review several semantic tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#Semantic_elements).

> **Group Discussion**: How does semantic HTML relate to the [Separation of Concerns]() that we discussed at the start of the class?

### Add CSS and JavaScript

During your application process, you wrote CSS code. Later in this course you will learn about JavaScript. Both are different languages from HTML.

A typical webpage will require three files, one for each language:

* `index.html`
* `styles.css`
* `main.js`

To use all of the files together, we have to tell the HTML code to load the other two files. Use the `<link>` tag to add the CSS file and the `<script>` tag to add the JavaScript:

```markup
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example Webpage</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>My webpage content.</p>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The `<link>` tag must be placed in the `<head>` element. Usually, the `<script>` tag appears near the end of the `<body>` element of the HTML page:

#### File Paths

The HTML file isn't always in the same directory as the CSS and JavaScript files. It is common for them to appear in an `assets` directory.

In the example above, the `<link>` would have to be:

```markup
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css">
```

### CSS Selectors

You learned about CSS selectors during your application. Let's review the most common selectors.

> You can review the most [Common Selectors](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/).

### CSS Properties

CSS properties allow you to change the way an element appears on your HTML page. You do this by assigning _values_ to _properties_. Consider the properties and values in CSS code below.

```css
p {
  color: darkslategrey;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.8em;
}
```

> **Group Exercise**: Think of a chair. It might be green or red, tall or short. As a group, brainstorm as many properties and values as you can imagine for a chair.

### Box Model

In CSS, every element is a box. An image is a box. A link is a box. The area around this box can be modified with properties that we call margins, borders and padding. Here's a diagram showing what the box looks like.

Complete exercises 5, 6 and 7 from the [exercise project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/html-css-git-exercises).

### Advanced CSS Selectors

You can use more advanced CSS selectors to limit your selections. Read about [Child Selectors](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/#child-selectors), [Sibling Selectors](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/#sibling-selectors), [Pseudo Classes](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/complex-selectors/#pseudo-classes), and other complex selectors.

Then complete exercise 8 from the [exercise project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/html-css-git-exercises).

### Git Branching

You have been using git to track the changes you make to your exercises project. Each time you commit, you save a copy of your files.

When you create a new branch, you create a separate line of commits.

With branches, you can work on two copies of your project and switch back and forth.

Complete exercise 9 from the [exercise project](https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/html-css-git-exercises) to learn how to use git branches.
