#### How we created a deck and random draw

So, first, we start the structure of the "deck" with an objects and an array:

```
let deck = {
    spade: [ 1, 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 ],
    fiori: [ 1, 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 ],
    cuori: [ 1, 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 ],
    quadri: [ 1, 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 ],

}

let mazzi = [ "spade", "fiori", "cuori", "quadri"]

```
