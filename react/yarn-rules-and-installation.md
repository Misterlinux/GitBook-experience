**Yarn** is a JavaScript **package manager** built on top of npm. It supports **offline** dependencies based on cache, and uses a lockfile to ensure consistent dependencies across different environments.

```javascript
//To istall in the teminal
yarn set version stable
yarn

//To check which version
yarn --version

//To use npm libraries/packages we use 
Yarn create react-app folder-name

//we can install using add
yarn add nodemon

//and to update we use up
yarn up

//Starts up the project with
yarn start
```
