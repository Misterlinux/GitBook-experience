**Node.js** is a _javascript environment_, we use **npm** (Node Package Manager) to install **modules** and use a **packages.json** file to track them.

To create a **React** application folder we run:

```
npx create-react-app (name of the app)

//its /public folder contains the app root
//its /src folder has the different page components
```

**React** is a _javascript library_ used for user interface, based on single-role **components**.
